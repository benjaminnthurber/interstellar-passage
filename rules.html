  <section class="container rules">
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Payment Secures the Seat, Not the Outcome.</strong> Passage guarantees transport, not comfort, timing, or docking proximity. If you arrive close enough to walk away, the job is considered complete.</li>
      <li><strong>Ask No Questions You Don’t Want Answers To.</strong> Routes, cargo histories, and crew backgrounds are not discussed. Curiosity has a higher fare than credits.</li>
      <li><strong>Departure Times Are Suggestions.</strong> Ships leave when lanes clear, scans pass, and captains decide it’s time. Miss it, and the stars won’t wait.</li>
      <li><strong>What Happens in Transit Stays in Transit.</strong> No logs. No records. No official acknowledgment that you were ever aboard.</li>
      <li><strong>Carry Only What You Can Explain Quickly.</strong> If security asks, you answer. If they don’t ask, you still might want the story ready.</li>
      <li><strong>Names Are Optional.</strong> The name you give is the name we use—for the duration of the trip only.</li>
      <li><strong>No Refunds, No Retries.</strong> Once engines spool, the fare is spent. Turning back costs more than most people expect.</li>
      <li><strong>If the Destination Changes, So Be It.</strong> Lanes shift. Beacons fail. Sometimes the safest port isn’t the one you paid for.</li>
